The Map Navigator project aims to develop a navigation system using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. It involves finding the shortest path between two locations on a map, considering factors such as distance and traffic. This project allows you to apply graph algorithms and data structures to solve real-world problems.

By implementing a map navigator, you will gain insights into graph representation, shortest path algorithms, and data visualization.
